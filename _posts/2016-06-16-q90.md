Blurrt were asked to join in with The Patron’s Lunch, a huge street party to celebrate The Queen’s patronage of over 600 charities and organisations on the occasion of her 90th birthday.

For this event, we looked for ways to visualise the public’s wider conversation around the event in as engaging a way as possible. The result saw huge screens placed up and down The Mall, primarily used for live video, displaying a variety of custom Blurrt visuals, all being fed by real-time social media posts.

I was the onsite tech, responsible for making sure everything went smoothly.

Some pictures of the day (and our visuals) are below.

Our view was slightly less glamorous.
