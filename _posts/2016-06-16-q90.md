<p>Blurrt were asked to join in with The Patron’s Lunch, a huge street party to celebrate The Queen’s patronage of over 600 charities and organisations on the occasion of her 90th birthday.</p>

<p>For this event, we looked for ways to visualise the public’s wider conversation around the event in as engaging a way as possible. The result saw huge screens placed up and down The Mall, primarily used for live video, displaying a variety of custom Blurrt visuals, all being fed by real-time social media posts.</p>

<p>I was the onsite tech, responsible for making sure everything went smoothly.</p>

<p>Some pictures of the day (and our visuals) are below.</p>
