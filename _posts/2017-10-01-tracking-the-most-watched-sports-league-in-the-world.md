For the 2017 season, Blurrt have been collecting tweets about Premier League football to provide analysis on the social media reaction.

I've previously written about how Blurrt used Twitter to generate a [social team of the week]( {{ '/social-team-of-the-week/' | prepend: site.url}} ). This season, however, we've not just been collecting tweets during matches; we've been collecting 24/7. This adds a new level of complexity, as not only do you have to deal with scheduling and caching reports, you also have to deal with reporting on a large dataset that can be collected very quickly.

Here's an overview of the first X weeks of the 2017 Premier League season on Twitter.
