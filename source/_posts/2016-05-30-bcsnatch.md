A 'sniper' for the <a href="https://www.bigcartel.com/">BigCartel webstore platform</a>. Used to buy limited edition items.

<h2>How It Works</h2>
When an item is added to a basket, BigCartel takes the item out of the pool of available stock and creates a session. The basket session will last ten minutes; if the item isn't checked out in this time, the item is put back in the pool of available stock.

BC-Snatch will output session cookies with items in the basket. By using a browser add on (such as <a href="http://www.editthiscookie.com/">EditThisCookie</a>) you can access these sessions and buy the items.

Each instance of BCSnatch will try to create ten sessions.

<h2>Installation</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/JamesFrost/BC-Snatch/releases/download/v1.0.1/BCSnatch.jar">Download the .jar here</a>.

<h2>Usage</h2>
